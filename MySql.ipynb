        "### 4. **Key Differences**\n",
        "#### **1. Data Structure**\n",
        "- **SQL**: Data is stored in tables with rows and columns, which are strictly defined by a schema.\n",
        "- **NoSQL**: Data can be stored in many different formats, including key-value pairs, documents (JSON, BSON), and graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Schema**\n",
        "- **SQL**: Schema is predefined. All records in a table must follow the same structure.\n",
        "- **NoSQL**: Schema is dynamic, meaning that each record (document) can have different fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. Scalability**\n",
        "- **SQL**: Typically scales vertically (requires better hardware for growth).\n",
        "- **NoSQL**: Designed to scale horizontally, meaning you can add more servers or nodes to handle increased load.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4. Transaction Handling**\n",
        "- **SQL**: ACID properties ensure reliable transactions (e.g., database transactions are fully completed or not executed at all).\n",
        "- **NoSQL**: Many NoSQL databases use the BASE model, which prioritizes availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **5. Query Language**\n",
        "- **SQL**: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language for querying relational databases.\n",
        "- **NoSQL**: Different databases have different query models. For example, MongoDB uses a query language for documents, and Cassandra uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **6. Flexibility**\n",
        "- **SQL**: Fixed schema means changes to the database schema (like adding or removing columns) can require significant work and downtime.\n",
        "- **NoSQL**: Schema-less design means data structures can be changed easily, without disrupting the database.\n",
        "\n",

        "  - Banking systems (transaction consistency is crucial).\n",
        "  - Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems.\n",
        "  - Enterprise applications that need structured data and ACID compliance.\n",

        "1. **FROM**:\n",
        "   - First, the data source (tables, views, or joins) is determined. It specifies from where to retrieve the data.\n",
        "   - Example: `FROM Employees`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **JOIN**:\n",
        "   - If there are any joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN), they are executed after the FROM clause to combine rows from two or more tables.\n",
        "   - Example: `JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID`\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **WHERE**:\n",
        "   - The WHERE clause filters the rows based on specified conditions.\n",

        "   - Example: `WHERE Employees.Age > 30`\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **GROUP BY**:\n",

        "   - Example: `GROUP BY DepartmentID`\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **HAVING**:\n",
        "   - After grouping, the HAVING clause is used to filter the groups based on a condition.\n",
        "   - It acts like a WHERE clause, but for aggregated data.\n",
        "   - Example: `HAVING COUNT(EmployeeID) > 5`\n",

        "6. **SELECT**:\n",

        "\n",
        "7. **DISTINCT**:\n",
