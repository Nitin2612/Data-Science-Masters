        "###1. Encapsulation:\n",
        "- Definition: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. It also involves restricting access to certain details of an object to prevent outside interference and misuse.\n",
        "- Key Concept: Access to the object's internal data is typically controlled using access modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected). This ensures that the internal state of the object can only be changed through well-defined methods.\n",
        "- Example: Using getter and setter methods to access and modify the attributes of an object instead of directly accessing the variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. Abstraction:\n",
        "- Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows the programmer to focus on the high-level functionality while ignoring the low-level implementation.\n",
        "- Key Concept: By exposing only relevant data and behaviors to the outside world, abstraction simplifies interaction with the object. This is typically achieved through abstract classes or interfaces in programming languages like Python.\n",
        "- Example: A Car class might have a start() method that abstracts the complexity of how the car starts, without needing to show the internal workings (engine start process, fuel system, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "###3. Inheritance:\n",
        "- Definition: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent (base) class and the child (derived) class.\n",
        "- Key Concept: A derived class can inherit from one or more base classes and can also extend or override methods of the base class.\n",
        "- Example: A Dog class might inherit from an Animal class, gaining common properties like name and methods like speak(), while also defining its own unique behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "###4. Polymorphism:\n",
        "- Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It also allows for methods to be overridden to perform different tasks based on the object calling the method.\n",
        "- Key Concept: The same method or property name can have different implementations depending on the object that is invoking it. This makes code more flexible and extensible.\n",
        "- Example: A speak() method in both the Dog and Cat classes might be implemented differently, but both can be called in the same way on objects of type Dog or Cat.\n",
